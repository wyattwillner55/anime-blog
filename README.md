# Anime Blog
    
## Description
    
The goal of this project is to create a review board for anime with individual user profiles and future recommendations based on the level of engagement with a particular intellectual property. There will be a sign-up page, a login page, a profile page, and a trending page. The trending page will be accessible to anyone irrespective of having a user profile but will be read-only unless the individual has one. Users will see a text box where they can write their anime review and have the option of posting via a create button that, on click, will display the new post on their profile page. The profile page will have all of the usaerâ€™s previous reviews in order starting with their most recent review. Users will also have the option of deleting previous reviews from their profile page.
